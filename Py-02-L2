#Basic Conditions
#Lab Py-02-L3 introduces the "elif" statement. I've added it here.

#these variables capture the user's name and age.
name = (input("What is your name? "))
age = int(input(f"How old are you, {name}? "))

#If the user is over 21, greetings. If the user is 21, drink responsibly. Otherwise, admonishing statement.
if age > 21:
    print(f"Hi, {name}, get your drink on.")
elif age == 21:
    print("You're legal now. Drink responsibly.")
else:
    print(f"C'mon, {name}, you know better than that.")
